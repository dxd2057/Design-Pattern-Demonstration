# Design Pattern Demonstration

This is the C++ illustration for some examples of the design pattern mentioned in the book "Head First: Design Pattern"

I confirm that I have completed all the assignments given in this course. This project is conducted with another fellow student. My teammate is @lcnguyencs

We only discuss four design patterns:
1. [Observer Pattern](https://tome.app/lcnguyencs/observing-the-unseen-a-journey-through-the-observer-design-pattern-clgw4g8wu0eyo1z3zhk0oaztt)
2. [Decorator Pattern](https://tome.app/lcnguyencs/dress-up-your-code-the-decorator-design-pattern-clgwdqzgj148c6j43fl0gk6s1)
3. [Factory Patterns](https://tome.app/burning-photos/building-better-objects-the-power-of-the-factory-pattern-clgxhxiwi09y8bt41lwgup69u): Simple Factory pattern, Factory Model Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern
4. [Singleton Pattern](https://tome.app/dxd2057/singletons-unleashed-one-thread-vs-many-threads-clgxj6i2i09rt8a431ddhkwxi): lazy initialization and safe-thread initialization
